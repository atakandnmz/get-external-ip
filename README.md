# get-external-ip

This is very small command line bash script that prints your external ip address to console. Sometimes it may be very useful.
If you want to use the tool directly from command line you should copy getext.sh into your "/usr/local/bin" folder. You can do this by following these instructions:

1. $ git clone https://github.com/haruncetin/get-external-ip.git
2. $ cd get-external-ip
3. $ sudo cp getext.sh /usr/local/bin/getext
